Sir,I also want to contribute in this project 
Kindly allow me for this
I am good at this skill
I can also contribute to this code 
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namesapce std;


int add(int a,int b)
{
     int sum = a + b;
     return sum;
}

int main(){
     int x,y;
     cin >> x >> y;
     cout << "Sum = " << add(x,y) << endl;

    return 0;
}
Sir,This can be a better approach to solve this question.

Really such a nice observation from the new Guy ...
Amazing well done 
Good job
=================================
Another Approach
=================================

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){

  int a,b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  int sum = a + b;
  cout << sum << endl;

return 0;
}

Very Easy approach then Previous one.......


==============================================
Third Approach Better One with the Time Complexity - O(log n)
===============================================================
I can also suggest a new approach If you allow me
